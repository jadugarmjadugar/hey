# Integrate with AWS Services

One of the common use case among customers running hybrid workloads is to keep configurations and secrets in AWS cloud and pull them on-demand when required. So part of this chapter lets see how we can integrate SSM parameter store and AWS Secrets manager with ECS tasks running outside AWS cloud.

## Usecase walkthrough

Here is the high level view architecture of the workload that we are going in this chapter

## Pre-requistes

* Setup the environment variables required to build ECS-anywhere cluster and run workloads using the newly created cluster.

> Note: Change the name of the CLUSTER_NAME and SERVICE_NAME if desired, for running multiple tests.

```bash
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
export ROLE_NAME=ecsMithrilRole
export CLUSTER_NAME=test-ecs-anywhere
export SERVICE_NAME=test-ecs-anywhere-svc
```

> Note: Change the value of AWS_DEFAULT_REGION to match the default AWS region.

* ECS cluster is up and running
* Vagrant VM is connected to ECS control plane and has the required network connectivity to access AWS cloud

## Summary

Here are the steps involved in running this workload:

* A new parameter is created in SSM parameter store with the name `PARAMETER_TEST_AWS`
* A new secret is created with the name `SECRET_TEST_AWS`
* Attach the required IAM policies to `ecsanywhereTaskExecutionRole` role, associated with the ECS task in order to access AWS Secrets manager, parameter store and AWS ECR
* A new ECS task definition is registered, part of which parameters and secrets gets injected as environment variables using `valueFrom` attribute
* A new ECS service registered to associate it with the ECS task created in previous step

## Step by step instruction

1. Navigate to the workload directory and execute `chmod` command to provide execute permissions on the shell scripts

    ```bash
    cd workload-management/ssm-secrets-manager
    chmod +x *.sh
    ```

2. Run the following command to setup environment variables required for this workload.

    ```bash
    source ./0-env.sh
    ```

3. Run the following command to create a new parameter in parameter store with the name `PARAMETER_TEST_AWS` and value `Hello world from SSM`

    ```bash
    ./1-create-parameter.sh
    ```

    **Output**

    ```bash
    Parameters created successfully
    ```

4. Run the following command to create a new secret in AWS secrets manager with the key `SECRET_TEST_AWS` and value `"{\"username\":\"someuser\", \"password\":\"securepassword\"}"`

    ```bash
    ./2-create-secrets.sh
    ```

    **Output**

    ```bash
    Secrets successfully created
    ```

5. Run the following command to create an ECR repository, build the ECS application and push it to ECR

    ```bash
    ./3-ecr-push.sh
    ```

    **Output**

    > Note: Policies required to access `AWS SecretsManager`, `AWS ParameterStore` and `AWS ECR` are attached to the ECS task execution role

6. Run the following command to create a ECS task and associated it with a ECS service to run the workload in vagrant VM (outside AWS Cloud)

    ```bash
    ./4-ecs-task-service.sh
    ```

7. The task will take a bit of time to get started, so wait couple of seconds and then open the browser and navigate to this URL `http://localhost:8080`, to see the below response:

    > Note: Values in parameter store and secrets manager are available part of `PARAMETER_TEST_AWS` and `SECRET_TEST_AWS` environment variables.

8. Run the following command to cleanup all the resources created part of this article

    ```bash
    ./5-cleanup.sh
    cd ../..
    ```
