# Offload Compute

Due to complaince reasons it quite common along customers to use AWS just for storage and configuration purpose and leverage their own data centers for workload processing. Part of this article lets see how we can address this usecase

## Usecase walkthrough

Here is the high level view architecture of the workload that we are going in this chapter

![OfflineWorkload](pics/OfflineWorkload.svg)

**Notes:**

* Lets see create a typical file processing workload, where a input file lands in an S3 bucket
* Lambda function listening to the S3 bucket will invoke an ECS task to process this file
* This ECS task will download the file from S3 to local disk, process it, save the data to a database (in this case dynamodb) and write the output file back to AWS S3
* Only difference here is instead of running the ECS task in AWS cloud we will be running in vargant VM installed on your local laptop

## Pre-requistes

* Setup the environment variables required to build ECS-anywhere cluster and run workloads using the newly created cluster.

> Note: Change the name of the CLUSTER_NAME and SERVICE_NAME if desired, for running multiple tests.

```bash
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
export ROLE_NAME=ecsMithrilRole
export CLUSTER_NAME=test-ecs-anywhere
export SERVICE_NAME=test-ecs-anywhere-svc
```

> Note: Change the value of AWS_DEFAULT_REGION to match the default AWS region.

* ECS cluster is up and running
* Vagrant VM is connected to ECS control plane and has the required network connectivity to access AWS cloud

## Summary

Here is the high level summary of all the steps involved to run this workload:

* Create a ECR repository for lambda function, run `sam build` and `sam deploy` which will take care of creating the lambda function, S3 input bucket with event trigger and Dynamodb table
* Attach the required IAM policies to `ecsanywhereTaskRole` role in order to provide access to the ECS task to access S3 bucket and ECS cluster
* Create a ECR repository for the ECS task, build the file processor module (written in Go) and push the docker image to AWS ECR
* Register a new ECS task

## Step by step instruction

1. Navigate to the root directory and run the following commands to provide execute permissions on the shell scripts

    ```bash
    cd workload-management/s3-trigger-ecs-task
    chmod +x *.sh
    ```

2. Run the following command to setup environment variables required for this workload.

    ```bash
    source ./0-env.sh
    ```

3. Run the following command to create a new ECR repository for AWS Lambda

    ```bash
    ./1-lambda-ecr-repo.sh
    ```

4. Run the following command to trigger a sam build and deploy

    ```bash
    ./2-sam.sh
    ```

    **Output:**

5. Run the following command to attach the required IAM policies to the ECS  task and execution role

    ```bash
    ./3-ecs-iam-roles.sh
    ```

    > Note: Permissions relates to `Dynamodb`, `S3` and `ECR` policies are attached to the ECS task role

6. Run the following command to create a ECR repository for file processor, build the Go module and push the docker image to ECR repository

    ```bash
    ./4-ecs-ecr-push.sh
    ```

7. Register the ECS task definition which will get triggered when the file gets dropped into the S3 input bucket

    ```bash
    ./5-register-task.sh
    ```

8. Run the following command to copy a sample input file `test.csv` to the input directory. This will automatically trigger the lambda function, which would invoke the ECS task (executed outside AWS cloud) to process the file

    ```bash
    ./6-test.sh
    ```

9. Once the execution of the ECS task completes, we can see both dynamodb and S3 updated with the output data, like below:

    **S3**
    ![s3](pics/s3.png)

    **Dynamodb**
    ![dynamodb](pics/dynamodb.png)

10. Run the following command to cleanup all the resources created part of this article

    ```bash
    ./7-cleanup.sh
    cd ../..
    ```

## Conclusion

This workload demostrates the power of ECS-anywhere, where the customer has the flexibility to pick between AWS cloud and their own data-center.
